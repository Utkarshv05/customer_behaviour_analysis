## 🔍 Steps Followed  

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration (Python)  
- Imported libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- Loaded dataset using `pd.read_csv()`  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Checked missing values, data types, and summary statistics  
  - Visualized data distributions and correlations  

---

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values using mean/median imputation  
- Removed duplicates and inconsistent entries  
- Standardized column names and data formats  

---

### 3️⃣ Data Analysis using SQL (PostgreSQL)  
- Uploaded cleaned data to **PostgreSQL**  
- Executed SQL queries to extract insights:  
  - Top-performing categories/products  
  - Monthly and regional trends  
  - Aggregations using `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, etc.  
- Verified SQL results with Python outputs for accuracy  

---

### 4️⃣ Visualization & Dashboard (Power BI)  
- Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL database  
- Built an **interactive dashboard** showcasing KPIs and trends  
- Added slicers for interactivity (Region, Category, Time Period)  
- Used clean, professional visuals (Bar, Line, Pie, Map Charts)  

---

### 5️⃣ Report & Presentation (Gamma App)  
- Summarized workflow, insights, and key findings  
- Created an AI-generated **presentation report** in **Gamma App** for professional storytelling  

---

## 📈 Dashboard Overview  
**KPIs Displayed:** Total Revenue, Profit Margin, Category Performance, Monthly Trends  
**Visuals Used:** Bar Chart, Line Graph, Pie Chart, Map Visualization  
**Interactive Filters:** Region, Category, Time Period  

> 💡 The Power BI dashboard enables stakeholders to explore real-time insights and make data-driven decisions.  

---

## 🧠 Results & Insights  

Key takeaways from the analysis:  
- 🏆 **Region X** contributes the highest sales share  
- 📉 **Product Category Y** shows a decline in Q3  
- 🔁 **Customer Retention** improved by 15% after targeted marketing  

These findings help guide marketing, sales, and retention strategies for better business outcomes.
